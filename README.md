# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration
The Phonepe pulse Github repository contains a large amount of data related to various metrics and statistics. The goal is to extract this data and process it to obtain insights and information that can be visualized in a user-friendly manner.
The solution must include the following steps:
1. Extract data from the Phonepe pulse Github repository through scripting and
clone it..
2. Transform the data into a suitable format and perform any necessary cleaning
and pre-processing steps.
3. Insert the transformed data into a MySQL database for efficient storage and
retrieval.
4. Create a live geo visualization dashboard using Streamlit and Plotly in Python
to display the data in an interactive and visually appealing manner.
5. Fetch the data from the MySQL database to display in the dashboard.
6. Provide at least 10 different dropdown options for users to select different
facts and figures to display on the dashboard.
The solution must be secure, efficient, and user-friendly. The dashboard must be
easily accessible and provide valuable insights and information about the data in the
Phonepe pulse Github repository.

Results:
The result of this project will be a live geo visualization dashboard that displays
information and insights from the Phonepe pulse Github repository in an interactive
and visually appealing manner. The dashboard will have at least 10 different
dropdown options for users to select different facts and figures to display. The data
will be stored in a MySQL database for efficient retrieval and the dashboard will be
dynamically updated to reflect the latest data.
Users will be able to access the dashboard from a web browser and easily navigate
the different visualizations and facts and figures displayed. The dashboard will
provide valuable insights and information about the data in the Phonepe pulse
Github repository, making it a valuable tool for data analysis and decision-making.
Overall, the result of this project will be a comprehensive and user-friendly solution
for extracting, transforming, and visualizing data from the Phonepe pulse Github
repository.
